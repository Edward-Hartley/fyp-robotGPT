# GPT Powered Robotic Agent


![Robot in Action](./examples_images/robot_gpt)

My final year project focusing on using large language models to generate code for robot control

## Project Setup

This project requires Conda for setting up the necessary environments. Follow the instructions below to get everything up and running.

### Conda Environments

You will need to create multiple Conda environments, each defined in the `conda_envs_requirements/` directory. Each environment has its own corresponding YAML file. Hereâ€™s a list of the environment files:

- `conda_envs_requirements/environment_1.yaml`
- `conda_envs_requirements/environment_2.yaml`
- `conda_envs_requirements/environment_3.yaml`

To create an environment, use the following command:

```bash
conda env create -f conda_envs_requirements/environment_1.yaml
